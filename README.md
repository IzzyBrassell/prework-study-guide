# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can see the basic notes I took for each section. I started by adding what most codestrings could do but I wouldn't be able to follow that page as a newcomer so I took time to explain different things in a way I could remember. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows), also you can just right click and hit inspect. A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

## Credits

I watched a few videos by the youtuber Web Dev Simplified to better understand different tools explained in the prework.
